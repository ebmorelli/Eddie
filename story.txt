Cletus was just a farmer from a small town in Arkansas.  His beet farm was not very successful, yet he had no intention of doing anything other than tend to his beets.  Then on one Wednesday morning, his life changed forever. A fairy appeared in front of him and offered him a magic wand which allows him to plant seeds instantly and get beets ripe every other day. He became rich overnight, as rich as he became lazy.
